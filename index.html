        <p>I consider myself a digitial solutions architect. Coming from an engineering background, I take pride in connecting the dots to provide innovative ways to solve problems.
          <br>I am passionate about research and development, teaching and mentoring, and taking a lead role in implementing practical solutions which is evident in my track record so far.
          <br>I am Cofounder and CTO of an <a href="http://www.honeyflowafrica.com/">Agtech startup</a> that uses a combination of technologies to make bee keeping much simpler.
          <br>I am also a tech consultant and reseach analyst for a digital solutions firm that performs a variety of contracts for Nigerian government agencies specifically in the telecommunications and ICT industry.
          <br>I became an embedded systems mentor in a hardware incubation hub where I led several teams in emebedded systems design courses and solutions. I am still involved in some in-house projects.
